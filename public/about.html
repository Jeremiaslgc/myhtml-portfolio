<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Despite that my background is from Educational Sciences, where I gained experience as researcher, teacher, paper
  reviewer, and student advisor; I've always passion for the IT field due to my excitement to learning new things. A time ago I started to learn
  programming and, specifically, web development. When I finished the EFA Course of Programming I made a one month internship as CRM functional
  consultant at Blink-iT. I like the details and recognize when I have limitations so that I can overcome them</p>
